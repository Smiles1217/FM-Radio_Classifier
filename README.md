# FM-Radio_Classifier
This is a re-upload of the 2019-2020 Senior Design Capstone project completed by Sam Miles, Breanna Bonsall, Ben Rahman, Zach Litkenhaus, and Brandon Ramsey.

**NOTE: I WAS NOT THE SOLE DEVELOPER ON THIS PROJECT, THIS WAS A TEAM EFFORT.**
This project was also completed under the sponsorship and in collaboration with NSWC Crane Naval Base.

The goal for this project was to classify FM radio signals into their respective musical genres using machine learning in nearly real time.

Our approach uses Googles TensorFlow framework and the Keras API to create a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of the spectrogram generated by the Librosa library from the raw audio signals. The FM radio is recieved using the following USB-A Software Defined Radio antenna:

The FMA Small Dataset was used for network training and testing:
